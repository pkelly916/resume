A single-page, one-column resume for software developers, forked from the original work done by Sourabh Bajaj. It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of use and installation when trying to update the resume. The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands have been added to make layout easier. The main sections in the resume are objective, education, technical skills, experience, and projects.
